# gamma_rays_scattering
This project studies Gamma Ray transport through a material medium, exploring radiation-matter interactions. Key coefficients such as absorption, backscattering, and transmission are defined, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to predict the effects of Gamma Ray interactions.
