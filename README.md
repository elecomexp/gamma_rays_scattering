# Gamma Rays Scattering

This project focuses on the study of Gamma Ray transport through a medium, exploring the interaction between radiation and matter. After defining key coefficients, such as absorption, backscattering, and transmission, Monte Carlo simulations are used to predict the effects of Gamma Ray interactions, providing valuable insights into this well-established field of physics.
